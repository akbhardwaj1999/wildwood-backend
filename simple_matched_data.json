It is a dark brown wood with a distinctive, striking grain pattern that provides a bold and dramatic look.\n\nOne of the key benefits of African wenge for carving is its extreme hardness. This makes it a very strong and durable wood that can withstand heavy use and wear, making it ideal for high-wear carvings.\n\nAnother advantage of African wenge is its resistance to decay and rot. It is a naturally oily wood that is highly resistant to moisture and pests.\n\nAfrican wenge is also known for its unique and striking visual appeal. Its dark color and bold grain pattern make it a popular choice for decorative carvings.\nOverall, African wenge is a versatile and highly desirable hardwood for carving, offering extreme hardness, workability, resistance to decay and pests, and a bold and striking appearance.\n\nMorado: A very rare, exotic and extremley beautiful wood species.

I placed it on a high shelf; honestly, no one notices it's there, but it's the booked spot for it. I'm happy with the purchase. It's the color I wanted, and the bear's iconic pose. An emblematic bear, that's what I was looking for."

She was a tortoiseshell and I was thinking about painting it to match her, but this thing is so pretty and obviously crafted with care that I scrapped the idea. It’s a little bigger than I was expecting, but that is great for my set up. Shipping was fast from CA (I live on the East coast)."

The artist is very nice to work with when I had questions and shipped very quickly, each item packed with care. The sculpture itself is nicely done, smooth and detailed in the right places, and the choice of wood allowed us to pick one (cherry) that was actually pretty close to OC's orange fur color. It's very sweet looking and was one of the few items I found that really looked like a long-haired cat. It is lightweight, but sturdy, and looks very tasteful alongside our cat's urn as a memorial for him. Thank you so much for creating this beautiful art to help us memorialize him. It means so much to us!"

I had a tight deadline and he was very accommodating and professional. I am a massive fan of his work. I love the minimal style of his pieces. While being minimal the movement of the subjects are accentuated by his mastery of natural animal motions. I'll buy any sculptures of Abbysinian Cats he creates. The man is a true artist. Fan for life, right here. Purchase with supreme confidence, Etsy folk."

    "TITLE": "Exquisite Oak Owl. Majestic Handcrafted Delight. Available in different sizes and hardwoods.",
    "DESCRIPTION": "Delight in the presence of this Exquisite  Oak Owl, a true masterpiece for animal and owl enthusiasts alike.\n\nEach owl is Machined and carved from premium red or white Oak, showcasing the natural beauty and strength of this remarkable hardwood. With heights ranging from 3 to 6 inches, these owls possess an undeniable charm that will capture your heart.\n\nIn addition to Oak, I offer this magnificent creation in a variety of hardwood options. Choose the timeless elegance of white oak, the rich and luxurious walnut, the dark allure of wenge, or the captivating warmth of bubinga. Each wood imparts its unique character, ensuring a one-of-a-kind treasure that is exclusive to my shop.  Please browse my shop for the other options.\n\nCrafted with utmost care and attention to detail, our Oak Owl embodies the essence of nature's wisdom. It serves as a testament to my unwavering commitment to creating high-quality items that will bring you joy. \n\nIndulge in the beauty of this Exquisite Oak Owl and let it enchant your space with its gentle presence. Discover the perfect companion for your home or a heartfelt gift for a cherished animal lover.\n\nWood Color: Red oak typically has a light to medium reddish-brown color. This can add warmth and a rustic touch to your sculpture.\nGrain Pattern: Red oak is known for its prominent and open grain pattern with a coarse texture. This can give your sculpture a more textured and pronounced appearance.\nDurability: Red oak is moderately durable. While it can withstand wear and tear, it may not be the best choice for outdoor sculptures exposed to the elements.\nJanka Hardness: Red oak has a Janka hardness rating of approximately 1,290 lbf, which means it's relatively hard and can resist denting.\nWhite Oak Sculpture:\n\nWood Color: White oak exhibits a light to medium brown color with a grayish or olive tint. It imparts a more neutral and classic look to your sculpture.\nGrain Pattern: White oak offers a fine and even grain with a closed, non-prominent grain pattern. This results in a smoother, more uniform appearance for your sculpture.\nDurability: White oak is highly durable and is exceptionally resistant to decay and rot. It's a top choice for sculptures exposed to outdoor conditions.\nJanka Hardness: White oak has a Janka hardness rating of approximately 1,360 lbf, making it even harder than red oak and more resistant to damage.\nWhen choosing between red oak and white oak for your sculpture, consider the aesthetics you prefer and where the sculpture will be displayed. Red oak may be suitable for indoor use, especially if you appreciate a textured, warm appearance. White oak, on the other hand, is an excellent choice for outdoor sculptures or if you desire a smoother, classic look that can withstand the elements.\n\nUltimately, your choice should align with your artistic vision and the environment in which the sculpture will be showcased. Both types of oak offer unique qualities that can enhance the beauty of your artwork.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "When we lose a loyal companion, we long for a way to keep their spirit close. This hand-carved Rottweiler sculpture is more than just wood — it’s a quiet, powerful tribute to the bond we never stop feeling.\n\nLovingly crafted in my small garage woodshop, this piece is made from African Wenge — a dark, richly grained hardwood known for its strength, depth, and quiet elegance. The wood’s deep chocolate tones carry a natural warmth, and subtle striping brings this noble Rottweiler to life with a sense of stillness and soul.\n\nEach curve is carved with intention. Every angle, a silent reminder of the sturdy devotion and gentle protection Rottweilers are known for. Whether displayed on a shelf, nestled near a photo, or held in a quiet moment of reflection, this sculpture stands as a heartfelt symbol of the bond you shared.\n\nNo two pieces are ever the same — the character of the wood ensures that every sculpture carries its own fingerprint, just like the pet it honors.\n\nIf you’re looking for a way to keep a beloved companion near, or offer someone a meaningful gift in their time of loss, this Rottweiler keepsake may be the comfort you didn’t know you needed.",

I love having a dark Persian from the Wenge wood and a light Persian from the maple wood. These are just beautiful carvings and I highly recommend them. One really nice thing is that they are carved by the artist and not something mass produced from another country, so that makes them very special. Communication was great, shipping was fast, and packaging was very secure. A++++"

He was such a sweet boy and this is a wonderful tribute to him. I was crazy about these Persian cats the moment I saw them. Steven is a wonderful artist and seller.
